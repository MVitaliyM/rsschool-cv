## About Me
I want to gain new knowledge and skills in the courses and learn how to apply them in practice, to start an IT career
and move forward in that direction. Now having a lot of free time, I decided to use it to study what I have been interested in for many years.
I consider myself a __hardworking__, **inquisitive** and **communicative person**. My main motto is "Nothing is impossible".
